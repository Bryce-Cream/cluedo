 I'm trying to make a clue AI but first I need to make the game of Clue in Pygame

# Basic Design and Gameplay of Clue
## Components
- 9 rooms on a board
- 6 characters
- 6 weapons
- One die
## Gameplay
1. A random player is selected to start. The turn order continues clockwise 
2. Each turn a player attempts to reach a room to investigate and make a suggestion.
3. Move your player by rolling the die or taking a secret passage in corner rooms.
4. Once you make a suggestion, starting in a clockwise order each player (if possible) must prove the suggestion is false by showing one card that matches the suggestion to the suggester.
5. At the end of your turn, you can make a final accusation or end your turn.
6. If you make a final accusation and are wrong. You are out.
